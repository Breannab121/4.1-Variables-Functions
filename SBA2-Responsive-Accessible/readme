For this project, I created a website focused on the art of food criticism.
My services include detailed reviews of restaurants, menus, and pop-up events, aimed at helping businesses promote themselves through honest, insightful feedback that attracts more customers to their establishments.
You can easily navigate the site using the links in the navigation bar, as well as the Call to Action button located below the hero section.
